I am a PhD student and a researcher at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

My research interests are in Adversarial Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Privacy-preserving Machine Learning.


## Professional Experience
Currently, I am working as a Researcher on the project **"Improving Malware Attribution Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques"**. My work focuses on applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract information from Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) reports, aiming to enhance malware attribution processes against such cyber threats.

Additionally, I have professional experience as an AI Development Lead, focused on real-time event detection and tracking in video footage for the construction industry.
