👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student and a researcher at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

🔬 My research interests are in Adversarial Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Privacy-preserving Machine Learning!

📽️ I am also interested in helping others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently, I am working as a Researcher on the project **"Improving Malware Attribution Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques"**. My work focuses on applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract information from Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) reports, aiming to enhance malware attribution processes against such cyber threats.

Additionally, I have professional experience as an AI Development Lead, focused on real-time event detection and tracking in video footage for the construction industry.


## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I will make my teaching materaial available in my [website](https://w-dan.github.io/teaching/).
